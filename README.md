# AI-shooting-simulation

Click the right click on your mouse and there will be 4 options:
1. Play/Pause - Play or pause the simulation.
2. Create Security Map - Create the Security Map.
3. Who Shot The Squire? - Kill both of the squires to see the soldiers adapt to the situation and start getting supplys on their own.
4. Tip The Bartender - Just tip the bartender, it's free ;)

Every soldier has his own limits of fighting - minimum ammo and health he wills to fight with, 
otherwise he will ask the squire to give him those so he can continue the fight.

Bullets are long range weapon and used also in case there are no grenades remain, the grenades are being used as short range weapon.
The damage done by each weapon also varies according to the distance of the hit.

Have fun!
